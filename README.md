# Liga MX Data Pipeline & Feature Engineering

This project focuses on building a robust and scalable data processing pipeline for Liga MX match data using Python.

The main goal is not just model training, but the creation of a **clean, well-defined dataset and feature engineering system** that can later be consumed by predictive models.

## Project Objectives
- Extract and structure Liga MX match statistics
- Design and formalize football-related features (form, momentum, performance trends)
- Build a reusable data processing pipeline
- Prepare high-quality datasets for future machine learning models

## Current Focus
The project is currently centered on:
- Data ingestion and transformation
- Feature definition and validation
- Improving data consistency and football interpretability

Model development is treated as a downstream consumer of the data pipeline.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas / NumPy
- Custom data processing modules

## Project Status
🚧 Work in progress — actively expanding feature engineering and pipeline robustness.

## Motivation
This project is part of a long-term learning path focused on applied data science, machine learning, and real-world football analytics.
